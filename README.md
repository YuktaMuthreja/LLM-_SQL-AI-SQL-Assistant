# LLM-_SQL-AI-Assistant

This project is a comprehensive Language Model (LLM) initiative utilizing Google Palm and Langchain. The objective is to create a system capable of interacting with a MySQL database. Users can pose questions in natural language, and the system responds by transforming those inquiries into SQL queries and subsequently executing them on the MySQL database. The dataset used for this project is derived from a sample retail store, which stores its inventory, sales, and discount information in the MySQL database. The following are some of the sample questions that it could ask:

  - What is the current quantity of white Adidas T-shirts remaining in our inventory?
  - If we were to sell all extra-small size T-shirts with discounts applied, what would be the total sales generated by our store?
    
The system can generate precise queries for the provided questions and carry out their execution on the MySQL database with intelligence.
